After the log transformation, the variables GDP, exchange rates, commodity, and stock prices imply stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plots of autocorrelation functions\n\n\nThe partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots… Figure 4 shows that the partial autocorrelation for interest rates is significant at first lag.
